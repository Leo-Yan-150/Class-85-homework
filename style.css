/*This is empty why did I create this I need to start questioning my existance while thinking about why I created this file
 called style.css since it is not useful until it is useful for this project why am I writing this IDK I am just tired and
  want to keep writing somehow why am I doing this to myself I literally need to get to the code now why am I still here 
  writing this eventhough I could just go sleeping wow this is a long line that is totally needed why am I still writing 
  well that is the end I guess for this completely unessary super long line that made me question my existance goodbye and 
  have a great day or have a great rest of your day and why are you reading this still it is so long now that I even got 
  tired typing this out why are you still reading wow this is completely nessary well back to the nessary parts which means
   coding stuff and questioning my existance and if this took you less than a minute to read then you are legally one of 
   the best readers I know since I canot even read that fast well that is a nice line of code that is totally unessary I 
   need some sleep now goodbye.*/
